# Titanic - Data Analysis with Pandas

An exploratory data analysis of the famous Titanic dataset, created to practice and demonstrate data manipulation and visualization skills using the Pandas library in Python.

### üéØ Project Goal

This project was developed as a practical exercise to deepen my knowledge in data analysis. The main focus was on using the **Pandas** library to perform data cleaning, processing, manipulation, and exploration, aiming to extract insights from the Titanic dataset.

### üìä Dataset

The dataset used is "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster," one of the most well-known datasets on the Kaggle platform. It contains demographic and travel information for 891 passengers of the RMS Titanic.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Analysis and Findings

The exploratory analysis aimed to answer several questions about the Titanic passengers. The key findings are visualized in the charts below, generated from the data.

* **Survival Rate by Sex and Ticket Class:** The analysis shows clear disparities in survival based on gender and the passenger's ticket class.

* **Survival Rate by Age and Fare:** Age was a critical factor, with different survival rates across various age groups. Similarly, the fare paid for the ticket also correlated with survival chances.

* **Survival Rate by Port of Embarkation:** The port where passengers embarked also shows a correlation with their survival rate.
